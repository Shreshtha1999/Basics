// char datatype , always needs to be written in single quotes 's' , we can also take each character as string eg: "a" but it will unecessarily take much more space which is not suggested

#include<bits\stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main(){

    char ch ;

    cout << "Enter the value of ch : "<<endl;

    cin >> ch;

    cout << ch ;

    return 0;
